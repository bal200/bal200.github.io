<h2 class="">Sandwich delivery vans: we're the link between you and your
customers</h2>
<p style="font-size: 110%;">LunchAlert lets your customers know the sandwich van has arrived
outside their work place.</p>
<p>Are you a sandwich delivery company that provides a van service to offices and factories? LunchAlert increases customer visits, and maintains repeat visits to your van.</p>
<h3>Workers rely on the sandwich van</h3>
<p>LunchAlert is good for customers as many rely on the sandwich van service to maximise their lunch break. They don't make their own sandwiches if they can rely on you.  Missing the van means a trip out to grab lunch that they didn't plan.  Many people like to shop on the Internet at lunchtime while eating their lunch.</p>
<p>LunchAlert is a simple mobile app that customers install on their smartphone.  As soon as your sandwich van arrives, they get a notification alert whether they are at their desk or doing other work activities.  They get this alert each and every day, and this is timed perfectly to your vans shutters opening for business outside.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>For the sandwich delivery driver there is a second matching phone app.  Once logged in, the driver just taps a single button at each drop.  This sends the alert to just the nearby customers, so only the local building is notified.  We've made the app simple to use so very little training is needed, and your drivers can concentrate on their job.</p>
<p>The customer app is available on the App store and Goole Play store, and is free to download and use.</p>
<h3>Send Offers</h3>
<p>You can send messages to all your LunchAlert using customers through the app, if you are running an offer or other marketing campaign.  Please speak to us if you have a message youâ€™d like to send, and we can push a notification out at a time of your choice directly to all your customers.</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>We'd love to answer all your questions about how LunchAlert can help your business. Fill in your contact details and we'll be in touch shortly.</p>
