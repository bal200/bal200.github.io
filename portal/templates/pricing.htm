    <h1 class="ui header">Pricing</h1>
    <p>Our delivery van notification system is based on a monthly subscription.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Pricing is based on the number of van drivers and devices used for your daily delivery rounds. Unlimited stops and unlimited customer alerts are included in the fixed monthly price.</p>
    <p><strong>&pound;40 pcm</strong></p>
    <p>That&#39;s roughly <strong>only</strong> 4 extra sandwich sales per day.&nbsp; We are confident that using the app will increase sales much more than this, easily covering the price.&nbsp; Also making your round quicker and increasing customer satisfaction at the same time.</p>
    <p>Payment is handled by a simple monthly Direct Debit.</p>

    <h2 class="ui heading">Multiple van discounts</h2>
    <p>If you would like to use LunchAlert on more than one delivery van, we can offer substantial discounts
    for each van.  Select the number of delivery vans below for a quick quote.</p>
